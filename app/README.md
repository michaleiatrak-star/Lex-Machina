# Lex Machina App — local runtime

This directory contains the application/runtime workstream for running the development Lex Machina corpus outside a vendor-specific host.

## Source of truth

The legal methodology remains in:

`Wersja rozwojowa rozpakowana/`

The application MUST NOT duplicate or silently rewrite legal skill instructions. Runtime code is responsible for:

- loading skills and resources;
- resolving declared dependencies;
- enforcing mandatory reads and fail-closed behavior;
- exposing provider-neutral tools;
- recording an auditable execution trace;
- invoking model providers through adapters;
- enforcing validation gates before a final/exportable result.

## Initial build gates

- **G0 — Baseline:** exact Lex commit recorded, corpus untouched.
- **G1 — Corpus Integrity:** all skill frontmatter parses, declared dependencies/resources resolve.
- **G2 — Resolver:** semantic resource paths resolve inside the allowed Lex root and traversal is blocked.
- **G3 — Routing:** legal execution loads `prawny-router-v3` first and required core gates are read.
- **G4 — Tool Safety:** model tools are mediated by a policy-enforcing Tool Broker.
- **G5 — Provider Conformance:** OpenAI/Anthropic/xAI providers normalize streaming + tool calls.
- **G7 — Vertical Slice:** router -> prawo-polskie-v2 -> one DR executes end-to-end.
- **G8 — HARD GATE:** unsupported legal references cannot silently become final.
- **G9 — Audit Completeness:** every final answer has a complete execution trace.
- **G10 — Export Gate:** invalid citations/verification block export.

## Current scope

The first implementation milestone is G0-G2. No UI work is considered release-critical until a legal vertical slice passes G7-G10.
